## About Me 
Hey! 👋

My name is Johan Herrera & I'm from Colombia 🇨🇴

I'm living in USA 🇺🇸

I'm 22 years old and I'm an autodidact.

Become a developer it's a dream for me that I haven’t the opportunity to work in something that I enjoy 👨‍💻

There's a lot of thing that I don't know but doesn’t matter what I'll learn anything to be better ⚡️🧠

I' m a problem solver, I don't like to hear problems, I like to hear options to solve it.

I always listen the critics, I always going to take them good.

I enjoy reading, playing guitar, learning things that blows my mind and laughing :)
