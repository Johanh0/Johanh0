## About Me 
The world saw me born in Colombia 🇨🇴, life took away my boundaries  and now I live in the USA 🇺🇸, I have an extreme hunger to learn and everyday I want to learn more 🧠, if I'm not learning, I'm dying, I found the code and in it I saw the opportunity to live a better life 👨‍💻, I have an unrelenting curiosity, everything that you can seeI do by my own it' beacuse I've learned on my own or I was blessed with somebody who teach me 🤝, I like to have interesting or funny conversations 💬, I like to read 📕, play guitar 🎸 and play soccer ⚽️, if I don't know something, I will learn it 💪.
