## About Me
The world saw me born in Colombia, life took away my boundaries  and now I live in the USA, I have an extreme hunger to learn and everyday I want to learn more, if I'm not learning, I'm dying, I found the code and in it I saw the opportunity to live a better life, I have an unrelenting curiosity, everything that you can seeI do by my own it' beacuse I've learned on my own or I was blessed with somebody who teach me, I like to have interesting or funny conversations, I like to read, play guitar and play soccer, if I don't know something, I will learn it.
